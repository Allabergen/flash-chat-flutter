# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Goal

The objective of this App is to learn how to incorporate Firebase into Flutter apps. I have used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. 


## What I have created

I have built a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
